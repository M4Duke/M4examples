TCP Echo server for PC and Client for CPC for testing M4 board
Run tcpserv.exe on your PC and run TCPECHO.BIN on your CPC.
Type the PC server IP when prompted, format like 192.168.1.10, afterwards you can send messages to the PC that will be echo'ed back.
This is purely for testing, no practical use!
